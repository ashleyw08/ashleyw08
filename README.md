Hello I'm Ashley! I am a Developer who is eager to expand my skill set and gain more professional experience. Much of my career has been in backend development with programming languages such as PowerOn (based on PL/1), PL/SQL, SQL. Mobile App Developer has always been my number one career goal, but full stack development has recently peaked my interest too. I'm currently engaging in the spring and Angular framework. I have experimented with android app development. Even though I am familiar with Java, SQL, and HTML, i would love to work on a project that involves other OOP languages. For example: C++, C#, C, Python, etc.   

Full disclosure! I'm not very imaginative when it comes to creating innovative apps. Most of my projects are to show my competency.
